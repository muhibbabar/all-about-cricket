          <h2>Rohit Sharma</h2>
          <p>Rohit Sharma is born in Bansod, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India. His International debut was in 23 June
                2007. He has won the 2007 T20 World Cup, and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy,and the 2024 T20 world
                    cup.He is officially retired from T20 Cricket. Also he is still captain for India. In the TATA IPL
                    he has represented Mumbai Indians.- Rohit Sharma has won six IPL titles: one with Deccan Chargers
                    and five as captain of Mumbai Indians (MI), making him the joint most successful captain in the
                    Indian Premier League. - He joined Mumbai in 2011 and became captain in 2013!Languid and easy on the eye, Rohit Sharma owned all the shots in the book when he emerged from the Mumbai suburbs as heir apparent to the Indian batting greats of the 2000s. It took him time and persistence, but by the 2010s he had become a colossus in white-ball cricket, and the man in charge of perhaps the most formidable league team in the first age of T20.That Rohit had talent was apparent to both the casual observer and to the trained eye. Fans were frustrated at the long wait for the potential to translate into runs, though selectors and captains, knowing better, kept backing him. At one point the word "talent" was Rohit's bugbear, a pejorative nickname for him on social media. Once it all clicked, though - the move to open the batting in ODIs late in 2012 was one particular turning point - things came together spectacularly.𝐂𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐤 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞

          <h2>Jasprit Bumrah</h2>
          <p>Bumrah is born in Ahmedabad,India.His debut was in 23 January 2016.He has won 1 International trophy in 2024.He is the NO1 bowler. He gets wickets in big moments.In the TATA IPL he represents Mumbai Indians.- Jasprit Bumrah is one of the key players in Mumbai Indians' (MI) rise to becomin gfive-time champions in the Indian Premier League (IPL).Arguably the most skilful fast bowler India have produced, Jasprit Bumrah has been central to their rise as a Test match power in the late 2010s and onward. All pistoning arms and legs in his unorthodox action and late release, he makes the ball do tricks few people not named Wasim Akram have.Bumrah was a yorker specialist early in his career, like his Mumbai Indians team-mate Lasith Malinga, and he learnt much about the art of hitting the blockhole from Malinga. But he developed to be so much more, adept at bowling swing both conventional and reverse, and able to produce deceptive speed, cut and dip almost at will. Within seven years of his debut he became the first in Test history to take 200 Test wickets at an average of under 20.𝐂𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐤 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐤𝐡𝐨𝐰 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐉𝐁.

          <h2>Fakhar Zaman</h2>
          <p>Born in Mardan, where the standard of batsmanship will always be measured by arguably Pakistan's greatest Test batsman Younis Khan, Fakhar Zaman has been on Pakistan's thankless domestic circuit for over five years with almost no attention. A left-handed opener with an unusually high backlift, Zaman relies on timing for his runs, which he's made plenty of. This is illustrated by his domestic average (42 in first class cricket and 49 in List A). But it wasn't until the Quaid-e-Azam trophy in 2016-17 that his form began to be noticed. Zaman scored 663 runs in the competition at an average of 51, including 170 in the second innings of the final, a game dominated by the twin centuries of former Pakistan captain Salman Butt.

          <h2>Virat Kohli</h2>
          <p>Virat is born in Delhi,India.He also used to be the former captian of Indian Cricket team.He made his debut in August 18 2008.He has won 3 international trophy's in 2011 Cricket World Cup, 2013 Champions Trophy and 2024 T20 World Cup. He is officially retired from T20 Cricket.In the TATA IPL he has represented Royal Challengers Bengaluru.Virat Kohli is arguably the most decorated player in the history of IPL to have not won an IPL trophy yet.India has given to the world many a great cricketer but perhaps none as ambitious as Virat Kohli. To meet his ambition, Kohli employed the technical assiduousness of Sachin Tendulkar and fitness that was in the league of top athletes in the world, not just cricketers. As a result, Kohli became the most consistent all-format accumulator of his time, making jaw-dropping chases look easy, and finding, in his own words, the safest possible way to score runs. Plenty of them.This ambition transferred seamlessly to his captaincy: he demanded more than ever of his bowlers especially the quick ones, often sacrificed a batter for bowling depth, and led India to a long stay at No. 1 in Test rankings and a first-ever series win in Australia. India won 40 out of the 68 Tests in which Kohli led, making him the fourth-most successful captain in the world, behind Graeme Smith, Ricky Ponting and Steven Waugh.𝐂𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐤 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐤𝐡𝐨𝐰 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐂𝐡𝐞𝐞𝐤𝐮! wikipedia Virat Kohli</p>

Rizwan has won no international trophy.His a very successfull Cricketer for Pakistan. In the HBL PSL he has represented Lahore Qalandars,Karachi King,and He is now captain for Multan sultans.For good measure, he was also the second highest runscorer at the 2021 PSL - behind only his Pakistan opening partner Babar Azam - and led Multan Sultans to the PSL title.For several years, it appeared Mohammad Rizwan's international career would only happen in a parallel universe, racking up domestic runs even as he struggled to get a game in the national side. But for someone who played an international for the first time in two years in January 2019, Mohammad Rizwan was spoken of remarkably frequently. Most often, he was used as a stick to threaten current first-choice Pakistan wicketkeeper and captain Sarfaraz Ahmed, but the Peshawar native had qualities of his own that suggested he might have been unfortunate not to play for Pakistan more often.𝐂𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐤 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐤𝐡𝐨𝐰 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐑𝐢𝐳𝐳𝐮! wikipedia Mohammed Rizwan</p>

          <h2>Saim Ayub</h2>
          <p>Saim Ayub is a Pakistani cricketer who plays for the Pakistan national cricket team and for Karachi Whites in domestic cricket. He made his international debut in T20 against Afghanistan in March 2023 and made his test debut against Australia in the third test in January 2024.He didn't play any recognised T20 cricket for more than a year after that but an explosive National T20 Cup season showcased a deliberate change in his intent as he finished as the second-highest run-scorer in the tournament at a strike rate streets ahead of any other batter. It earned him a brief Bangladesh Premier League gig, as well as a second chance at the PSL, one he grasped with both hands. With Peshawar Zalmi, he finished among the highest run-scorers in 2023 and 2024, with strike rates of 165.53 and 157.53 respectively. With Babar Azam playing a relatively more sedate role alongside him, Ayub's ability to get Zalmi off to flyers stood them in good stead.𝐂𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐤 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐤𝐡𝐨𝐰 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝑺𝒂𝒊𝒎 𝑨𝒚𝒖𝒃! wikipedia Saim Ayub</p>

Under his leadership, Lahore Qalandars won their first PSL title in the 2022 season and again went on to win the 2023 season, becoming the first team in PSL history to successfully defend their title. He is the first Pakistani to win the Garfield Sobers Trophy.A baby face perched on a two-metre body, Shaheen Afridi's story is trademark Pakistani. An 18-year old already comfortable in the green shirt of the national side, he's been on the radar of the national selectors for almost three years. In a more intimate circle, he was destined for great achievements well before his teenage years, with an international cricketer for an elder brother.Riaz Afridi made his solitary Test performance for Pakistan in 2004, when Shaheen was just four years old. He pushed Shaheen to hard-ball cricket following years of the younger brother enjoying success in Pakistan's informal tape-ball circuit. In 2015, FATA selected him after an U-16 talent hunt programme. His pace, physique and fitness won him an U-16 tour of Australia, and since then, he's been progressing through the youth squads.𝐂𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐤 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐤𝐡𝐨𝐰 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐄𝐚𝐠𝐥𝐞! wikipedia Shaheen Shah Afridi</p>

But that is almost precisely how Haris Rauf appeared, as if conjured simply by the power of the fast-bowling spirit that always seems to lurk around the country.Growing up completely outside of the formal Pakistan cricket system, a 24-year-old Rauf showed up to audition for Lahore Qalandars' player development programme in 2017, having only played tape-ball cricket until that point. He caught everyone's eye with his extreme pace, and after a successful season with Qalandars and a whirlwind BBL summer, he was fast-tracked into the national side.𝐂𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐤 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐤𝐡𝐨𝐰 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝟏𝟓𝟎! wikipedia Rauf</p>

Over 2007 and 2008, he also emerged, still improbably young, as a hot pace prospect. Even before he went to England on an U-19 tour, he had been picked out as a special talent by Akram himself at a pace camp he oversaw in Lahore in May 2007. By 2010, he had become the hottest pace bowling prospect around the world - but within months his career was in ruins following charges of spot-fixing.𝐂𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐤 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐤𝐡𝐨𝐰 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐌𝐢𝐫𝐮.!</p>
